# push_swap

The push_swap project is a sorting algorithm implementation that aims to efficiently sort a stack of numbers using a limited set of operations.

• Developed in the C programming language, the push_swap project focuses on sorting algorithms and data manipulation, specifically designed for the Linux operating system.

• I have implemented an efficient sorting algorithm using a combination of various operations such as pushing, swapping, and rotating elements within the stack.

• The push_swap program takes an unordered list of numbers as input and generates a sequence of operations required to sort the list in ascending order.

• The project's primary goal is to minimize the number of operations needed to sort the given list, optimizing the algorithm for efficiency and performance.

• Additionally, I have created a checker program that verifies whether the provided sequence of operations correctly sorts the input.

The push_swap project challenges understanding of sorting algorithms and requires thoughtful consideration of the most efficient operations to achieve sorting with the fewest steps possible.
